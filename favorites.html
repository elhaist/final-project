            <h3>by Hanya Yanagihara</h3>
            <!-- Summary from goodreads.com -->
            <p>In 1950, a young doctor called Norton Perina signs on with the anthropologist Paul Tallent for an expedition to the remote Micronesian island of Ivu'ivu in search of a rumored lost tribe. They succeed, in finding tribe but also a group of forest dwellers they dub "The Dreamers," who turn out to be long-lived but progressively more senile. Perina suspects the source of their longevity is a hard-to-find turtle. </p>

            <h2>Pachinko</h2>
            <h3>by Min Jin Lee</h3>
              <!-- Summary from Goodreads.com -->
            <p>Pachinko is a story of love, sacrifice, ambition, and loyalty. From bustling street markets to the halls of Japan's finest universities to the pachinko parlors of the criminal underworld, Lee's complex and passionate characters—strong, stubborn women, devoted sisters and sons, fathers shaken by moral crisis—survive and thrive against the indifferent arc of history.</p>
